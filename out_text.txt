Epic Elevators introduced this technology about a yearago and have installed it at
around forty locations all over in Gujarat. All of them have been running
successfully. The reason we suggest to change is because gearless elevators are
more energy efficient.

The reason behind that is geared motors consists of two main components
namely, the motor and gear box. Moreover without the gearbox no oiling and
greasing is needed which translate into lower maintenance costs. Gearless motors
are also known as permanent magnet synchronous motors which provide high
torque with a low speed.
